### Block Cipher Design - AES

#### **1. Key Concepts in Block Cipher Design**
   - **Confusion**: Ensures each ciphertext bit depends on several parts of the key.
     - Example: S-box (Substitution Box) and AddRoundKey steps in AES.
   - **Diffusion**: Each plaintext bit affects many ciphertext bits, hiding patterns.
     - Achieves the **avalanche effect**: A single bit change in plaintext alters about half of the ciphertext bits.

#### **2. Block Cipher Basics**
   - **Definition**: Encrypts data in fixed-size blocks using repeated application of a round function and a series of keys (round keys).
   - **Key Schedule Algorithm**: Generates unique round keys from the master key.

#### **3. DES (Data Encryption Standard)**
   - Developed by IBM, standardized in 1977.
   - **Key Length**: 56 bits; **Block Length**: 64 bits.
   - **Rounds**: 16, with each round using a 48-bit subkey.
   - **Feistel Scheme**: Uses a function `f` with expansion, substitution (S-boxes), and permutation to transform inputs.

   - **Attacks on DES**:
     - Differential, linear cryptanalysis, and exhaustive key search (solved in 3DES).
   - **3DES**: Extends DES by applying the algorithm three times with two or three unique keys, improving security.

#### **4. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**
   - **Successor to DES** (selected in 2000 after a competition).
   - **Structure**: Substitution Permutation Network (SPN) with four main operations per round: AddRoundKey, SubBytes, ShiftRows, and MixColumns.
   - **Variants**:
     - AES-128: 128-bit key, 10 rounds.
     - AES-192: 192-bit key, 12 rounds.
     - AES-256: 256-bit key, 14 rounds.

   - **Operations in AES**:
     - **SubBytes**: Byte substitution using an S-box.
     - **ShiftRows**: Rows of the state matrix are cyclically shifted.
     - **MixColumns**: Each column is transformed using matrix multiplication in a finite field.
     - **AddRoundKey**: Each byte of the state matrix is XORed with a byte of the round key.

#### **5. AES Mathematical Foundation**
   - **Finite Fields (GF(2^8))**: AES arithmetic is done in GF(2^8) (polynomials mod an irreducible polynomial).
   - **SubBytes Operation**: Uses S-box based on an inverse in GF(2^8).
   - **MixColumns**: Applies matrix operations to achieve diffusion.

#### **6. Security Properties of AES**
   - **Avalanche Effect**: A small change in input leads to significant changes in output after two rounds.
   - **Indistinguishability**: AES should be indistinguishable from a random permutation without knowledge of the key.

   - **Distinguishers**:
     - **Differential Distinguisher**: Uses function derivatives to detect non-randomness.
     - **Integral Distinguisher**: Observes input/output relationships across multiple plaintexts.
     - **Linear Distinguisher**: Finds approximations of the encryption function.

#### **7. Security Levels in Encryption**
   - **Key Recovery**: Attackers attempt to deduce the encryption key.
   - **Indistinguishability of Ciphertexts**: Ensures that ciphertexts are indistinguishable from random data.

#### **8. Modes of Operation**
   - **Purpose**: Encrypt data beyond a single block size.
   - **Types**:
     - **ECB (Electronic Codebook)**: Encrypts each block independently; vulnerable to patterns.
     - **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)**: Encrypts with feedback; ciphertexts depend on all previous blocks, mitigating patterns but requires sequential processing.
     - **CTR (Counter Mode)**: Uses a counter for each block, enabling parallel processing.
   
   - **Birthday Paradox**: After encrypting 2^32 blocks in CBC, there's a high probability of collisions, compromising security.

#### **9. Padding in CBC Mode**
   - **Padding Requirement**: Messages must be a multiple of block size.
   - **Padding Oracle Attack**: Vulnerable padding methods can allow attackers to infer information about the plaintext.

#### **10. Conclusion**
   - **Confidentiality**: Achieved through encryption but requires additional measures for integrity and authentication.
