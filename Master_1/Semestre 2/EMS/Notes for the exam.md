# EMS - CM5 & CM6 Notes: Peripherals, Interrupts & JTAG

##  General Concepts

###  What Are Peripherals?
- Peripherals allow an MCU to interact with the outside world via **pins**.
- Pins can be:
  - **GPIO**: General Purpose Input/Output.
  - **Alternate Functions**: Serial interfaces, ADC, DAC, display drivers, etc.

###  Multiplexing
- Each pin can be routed to multiple peripherals ‚Äî via software-controlled **multiplexers (MUX)**.
- Only one function active per pin at a time.

---

## üñ≤Ô∏è GPIO (General-Purpose I/O)

### As **Output**:
```c
// Set PB12 as output and drive high
GPIOB_MODER |= (1 << 24);      // Set mode
GPIOB_MODER &= ~(1 << 25);
GPIOB_ODR |= (1 << 12);        // Output Data Register
```

### As **Input with Pull-Up**:
```c
// Set PA8 as input with pull-up resistor
GPIOA_MODER &= ~((1 << 16) | (1 << 17));
GPIOA_PUPDR |= (1 << 16);
GPIOA_PUPDR &= ~(1 << 17);
```

> üì¶ These registers are **memory-mapped**, meaning they live at fixed memory addresses outside the CPU core.

---

##  Memory Hierarchy & Buses

###  Common Bus Systems:
- **AHB (Advanced High-Performance Bus)**: High-speed memory & DMA transfers.
- **APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus)**: Slower, used for peripherals like UART/SPI.

###  Memory Access via DMA:
- **DMA (Direct Memory Access)**: Offloads repetitive memory transfers from the CPU.

---

##  Serial Communication Peripherals

###  UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)
- **Asynchronous** (no shared clock).
- Full duplex (TX + RX).
- Common for debugging, CLI interaction.
- Settings: `115200 8N1` = 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit.

>  **Baudrate**: Bits per second.

###  SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
- **Synchronous** (uses clock signal).
- 4 wires: `MOSI`, `MISO`, `SCK`, `CS`.
- Full duplex, high-speed, simple protocol.

### I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
- 2 wires: `SDA` (data), `SCL` (clock).
- Supports multiple controllers/targets (7-bit addressing).
- Open-drain lines + pull-up resistors required.

>  **Open-Drain**: Pin can only pull low or float, useful for shared lines.

# EMS - CM6: Interrupts and JTAG

##  What are Interrupts?
- An **interrupt** signals the CPU that an event needs immediate attention.
- Saves current state (context) and jumps to a handler: the **ISR (Interrupt Service Routine)**.

### Types:
- **IRQ**: Standard, maskable interrupt from peripherals.
- **NMI**: Non-maskable interrupt. Cannot be disabled, used for critical events.

---

##  NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller)
- Prioritizes and routes interrupt requests.
- Stores handler addresses in a **vector table**.
- Takes ~12 cycles to enter an ISR, 6 to jump between ISRs.
- Can handle **nested interrupts** (ISR interrupted by higher priority ISR).

```c
// Vector table entry for UART
.word USART1_IRQHandler
```

---

##  Vector Table Example

```asm
.word _estack             // Top of stack
.word Reset_Handler       // Reset entry
.word NMI_Handler         // Non-maskable
.word HardFault_Handler   // HardFault
.word USART1_IRQHandler   // UART interrupt handler
```

---

##  ISR Best Practices
- Keep them **short** and **efficient**.
- Avoid loops, blocking calls.
- Use **volatile** or synchronization mechanisms (like semaphores) for shared variables.

---

##  JTAG & SWD (Debugging Interfaces)

### JTAG (Joint Test Action Group)
- Hardware debug interface.
- Used for:
  - Boundary scan (testing PCB connections).
  - Debugging MCU internal state (registers, breakpoints).

### Key Signals:
- `TCK`: Test Clock
- `TDI`: Data In
- `TDO`: Data Out
- `TMS`: Mode Select

### SWD (Serial Wire Debug)
- ARM-specific alternative to JTAG.
- Uses only 2 pins: `SWCLK`, `SWDIO`.
- Accesses same debug features using fewer pins.

---

##  Debugging Tools
- **OpenOCD**, **ST-Link**, **Segger J-Link**: Interface between PC and chip.
- **Ozone**, **GDB**, **STM32CubeIDE**: Software for debugging.

---

##  Cool Tools
- **JTAGulator**: Helps discover unknown debug/test points.
- **SpritesMods**: Hardware reverse engineering.
- **XIP (Execute in Place)**: Run code directly from external memory via SPI.

## Tips

- Registers `R0`‚Äì`R3`: Used to pass arguments.
- `R0`: Always used for return value.
- `LR` (R14): Link Register, holds return address after a `BL`.
- `SP` (R13): Stack Pointer.
- Always `PUSH {LR}` before a `BL` inside a function, and `POP {PC}` to return.
